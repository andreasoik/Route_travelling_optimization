The most efficient route for a businessman traveling across Europe, covering the minimum distance.

I selected several popular cities in Europe and implemented the greedy algorithm of minimum insertions in Python to discover the optimal path for the businessman. Using the coordinates of these cities, I constructed a distance/cost matrix, calculating the distances in kilometers.

Furthermore, I couldn't overlook the inclusion of a map to enhance the analysis and present the results clearly. To achieve this, I utilized Tableau's services to craft an aesthetically pleasing map.
